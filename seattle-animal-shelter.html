  <p>Walter is house trained, crate trained and working on his leash manners. He does not enjoy nail trims and will need further desensitization in that department. 
    He does well with other dogs and the cats in his home, but needs management/supervision with cats or is prone to chasing. (Only dog savvy cats will be considered). 
    Walter loves his people and is quite loyal, but due to his need for consistency and leadership, only homes with older children will be considered
